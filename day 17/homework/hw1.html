<p>The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002.
The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4]
The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was longer.[5] Starting in mid-1986,
the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. 
In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra</p>
